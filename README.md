# PHP-SQL-and-Bootstrap-demo-website
In this project, I have used PHP and SQL and Bootstrap to create the websites. This is a CRUD (create, read, edit, delete) demo for my PHP project. Instead of using PHP PDO code, I used pure PHP to challenge myself. If you are interested in it, please check it out. It would be great if you leave me a feedback.
